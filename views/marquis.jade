          h1 MARQUIS FUZZ
          p.well.well-lg.opac The Marquis Fuzz is an old school fuzz box based on the first version Tone Bender, commonly known as the MkI.  <br /> <br />
            |This germanium fuzz produces a sound rich in harmonics and upper mid frequency punch, giving a fantastic, cutting push. <br /> <br />
            |The 'Sore' and 'Soar' controls are highly interactive, allowing you to get sounds from gated, velcro splutter, up to a sustaining, powerful kick in the guts that will not get lost in the mix. <br /><br />
            |While based on an almost 50 year old vintage design, the Marquis benefits from some new enhancements. Using NPN germanium transistors in a modern style negative ground circuit means it plays nice with your other pedals and any 9V (Boss™ style) power supply. Use of shielded cable, RF and power filtering, and individually tested and auditioned transistors ensures minimum idle noise. <br /><br />
            |Each Marquis Fuzz is hand built into a hand etched enclosure with a brushed finish.

              li 'More' control dictates the output level, or volume of the pedal.
              li 'Sore' controls the amount of sizzle and sustain.
              li 'Soar' control is similar to the MkI Tone Bender's 'Attack' control. Dial this down as well as your guitar's volume control for a more gated, splatty fuzz verging on velcro. Dial up for a more full and rich fuzz.
